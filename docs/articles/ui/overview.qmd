THe **ARD** UI is composed of several elements, illustrated below.

1. The *flow* panel: this is where the argumentation graph (nodes and edges)
  will appear, and where you may move the arguments and create attacks between
  them.

2. The *sidebar*: it contains several panels (see 3, 4, 5) that can be opened
  and close by clicking on their title.

3. The *node creation and update* panel: this is where you may create new
  arguments (nodes), or update a selected one.

4. The *import / export* panel: this is where you can export the argumentation
  graph to a format that can be shared (PNG, JSON) or used (Python) in your
  code. These formats can also be imported back into **ARD** to modify the
  argumentation graph.

5. The *save / load* panel: this is where you may save the graph in your
  browser memory, so you can access it later. This is purely local to your
  computer.

6. The *flow controls*: you may use it to change the current flow view, zoom,
  de-zoom, fit the graph into the view, and lock the view.
