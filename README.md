# Argumentation Reward Designer

This tool helps to create argumentation graphs that represent reward functions
for learning moral values in a reinforcement learning algorithm.

It is meant to work in conjunction with the 
[ethical-smartgrid](https://github.com/ethicsai/ethical-smart-grid) simulator:
the Python code this tool produces can be (almost) directly used to create
reward functions that work with the Ethical Smartgrid simulator.

The idea of using argumentation graphs that represent reward functions is
described in our paper:
